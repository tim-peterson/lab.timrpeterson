As the global population ages, there is increased interest in living longer and improving one’s quality of life in later years. However, studying aging is expensive and time-consuming. And despite successes in extending lifespan in model organisms, there still aren’t really any feasible solutions for delaying aging in humans. With space travel, scientists couldn’t know what it would take to get to the moon. They had to extrapolate from theory and shorter-range tests. Perhaps with aging, we need a similar moonshot philosophy. And though “shot” might imply medicine, perhaps we need to think beyond biological interventions. Like the moon, we seem a long way away from provable anti-aging therapies in humans. This review therefore focuses on radical proposals that we hope might stimulate discussion on what we might consider doing differently to increase human lifespan.
