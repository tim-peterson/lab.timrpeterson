Abstract. As the global population ages, there is increased interest in living longer and improving one’s quality of life in
later years. However, studying aging – the decline in body function – is expensive and time-consuming. And despite research
success to make model organisms live longer, there still aren’t really any feasible solutions for delaying aging in humans.
With space travel, scientists and engineers couldn’t know what it would take to get to the moon. They had to extrapolate
from theory and shorter-range tests. Perhaps with aging, we need a similar moonshot philosophy. And though “shot” might
imply medicine, perhaps we need to think beyond medical interventions. Like the moon once was, we seem a long way away
from provable therapies to increase human healthspan (the healthy period of one’s life) or lifespan (how long one lives).
This review therefore focuses on radical proposals. We hope it might stimulate discussion on what we might consider doing
significantly differently than ongoing aging research.
