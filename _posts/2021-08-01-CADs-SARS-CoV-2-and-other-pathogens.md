A recent high-profile study by [Tummino et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34326236/) questioned the in vivo utility of cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) as antivirals in mice against SARS-CoV-2. We find several issues with this study.

1. It curiously contradicts a similiarly high-profile study by the same group where they showed human evidence on CADs efficacy as antivirals against COVID-19. [See Figure 9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33060197/).
2. It contradicts numerous other in vivo studies on CADs on other pathogens in mice, humans, and other mammals. [Here is the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UOTl8eZ2zqORR-fZpTChG3sZu7zxPSOBcUEDD44H-qg/edit?usp=sharing) we've started so far of the CADs we are working on. It does not cover all CADs. The doc is editable, so please feel free to add additional citations you find.
3. It was not rigorously performed. The premise rests on a surprisingly modest set of experiments presented in Figure 5. Moreover, they didnâ€™t detect the in vivo marker of CAD activity (phospholipidosis) in these experiments. Therefore, they can not claim the CAD they tested was active.
4. Numerous CADs have shown success for COVID-19 (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine).
