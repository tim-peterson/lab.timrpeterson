<h3>Former lab members</h3>

**Jasmine Zhang (2019-2020)** - 

Jasmine graduated in 2020 from WashU. She did her thesis working with Ariella on our <b>10X Lifespan project</b>. Jasmine is planning to go ti medical school.


<hr>


**JiWoong Park (2016-2019)** - 

Ji Woong ("Ji") Park defended his Ph.D. thesis in August 2019. He was a Molecular Cell Biology (DBBS) PhD graduate student in the Peterson Lab. He now works as a data scientist at Humana. Ji graduated from Washington & Jefferson College with B.A. in Chemistry with Honors and minor in Neuroscience. His previous research experiences span cardiovascular molecular biology (Cincinnati College of Medicine), biophysical instrumentation (W&J), and protein biochemistry in axon degeneration (Wash U Med). Ji led the MORPHEOME - Molecular ORPHan PhEnOtype MatchEr project and was involved in establishing computational pipeline combined with wet-lab validation to elucidate novel genes in osteoporosis and depression. He is passionate about coding and was involved with LaunchCode in STL. In his spare time, he is an avid foodie (with photos to prove) and has been to 5 ramen restaurants in STL (Robata, Nami, Midtown, Death in the Afternoon, and Vista).

**Damon Burrow (2016-2019)** -

Damon is currently a BME Ph.D student startin in the Fall of 2019. Damon graduated from William Woods University where he majored in Biology with minors in Physics and Chemistry. His previous work includes research in clinical imaging to improve malignant tumor treatment in adaptive radiotherapy. His work specifically allows radiotherapy to be administered more accurately leading to decreased adverse effects and cancer recurrence and improved outcomes and improved quality of life for cancer patients. Damon plans to attend medical school and pursue a career in a surgical specialty and research such as orthopedic or neurosurgery. Damon works on the animal studies for the <b>Disruptive Innovation of Blockbuster drugs</b> project. He focused on the TBONE project.
