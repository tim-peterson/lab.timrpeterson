Damon Burrow is a new addition to the Tim Peterson Lab here at Washington University. Damon is a recent graduate of William Woods University in Fulton, MO where he majored in Biology with minors in Physics and Chemistry. His previous work includes research in clinical imaging to improve malignant tumor treatment in adaptive radiotherapy. His work specifically allows radiotherapy to be administered more accurately leading to decreased adverse effects and cancer recurrence and improved outcomes and improved quality of life for cancer patients. Damon plans to attend medical school and pursue a career in a surgical specialty and research such as orthopedic or neurosurgery.
