His previous work includes research in clinical imaging to improve malignant tumor treatment in adaptive radiotherapy. His work specifically allows radiotherapy to be administered more accurately leading to decreased adverse effects and cancer recurrence and improved outcomes and improved quality of life for cancer patients. Damon plans to attend medical school and pursue a career in a surgical specialty and research such as orthopedic or neurosurgery. Damon works on the animal studies for the <b>Disruptive Innovation of Blockbuster drugs</b> project.</div></div>
